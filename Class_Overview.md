Kubernetes Class — Linux Foundation Alignment
Recommended Materials & Certifications

Positioning note for students:
These resources support the class.
They do not replace judgment, ownership, or the labs you already do.

1️⃣ Core Certifications (Linux Foundation)
CKA — Certified Kubernetes Administrator

Linux Foundation
Certified Kubernetes Administrator

Why it belongs in here to make you suffer
    Focuses on operating Kubernetes, not theory
    Requires real command-line competence
    Emphasizes cluster lifecycle, networking, and troubleshooting
    Performance-based (no multiple choice)

What it maps to in SEIR
    Platform responsibility
    Calm under failure
    Reading system state instead of guessing

Who should take it
    All Kubernetes students after foundational labs
    Especially those targeting Platform Engineer, SRE, or Cloud Engineer roles

CKS — Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist
Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist

Why it belongs
    Forces students to think about blast radius
    Covers RBAC, pod security, network policy, supply chain
    Punishes “it works so ship it” behavior

What it maps to
    SEIR-I identity thinking, but at runtime
    Security as constraint, not decoration

Who should take it
    Students who want:
      MLOps
      Platform Security
      Identity-aware Kubernetes roles

3️⃣ Kubeflow-Specific Guidance (Important)

Linux Foundation does not certify Kubeflow directly, and that’s actually a good thing.

Recommended framing:

Kubeflow is a platform responsibility, not a “data science toy”
Students should demonstrate:
    Kubeflow pipelines
    Identity-bound access to experiments
    Artifact storage discipline
    Failure recovery (not just success paths)

Certs that indirectly support Kubeflow
    CKA (cluster ops)
    CKS (runtime security)
    Cloud platform certs (AWS/GCP) — secondary

Kubeflow without Kubernetes discipline produces dangerous engineers.
Kubernetes discipline without Kubeflow limits modern relevance.
